# Bank-Computer-Network-Packet-Tracer

In  this  project,  we  target  the  design  of  a  bank  computer  network,  with  two  branches,  using  a  set  of Virtual  Local  Area  networks  (VLANs) 
with  remote  access  and  secured  networking  using  Virtual Private  Networks  (VPN).  The  network  is  expected  to  offer  a  variety  of  services  to  different  groups of users  ranging from  simply connecting to the  Internet  to data  sharing and web services.
